	abstract = {An electron–positron pair spectrometer has been designed and constructed for the simultaneous measurement of energy- and angular correlations of e+e- pairs. Experimental results are obtained over a wide angular range for high-energy transitions in 16O, 12C and 8Be. The results showed that the angular correlations between 50 and 180°of the e+e- pairs in the energy range between 6 and 18MeV can be determined with sufficient resolution and efficiency in good agreement with the GEANT simulations.}
