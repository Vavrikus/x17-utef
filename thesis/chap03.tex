\chapter{Track Reconstruction}
\label{sec:track}
	As the first step of the reconstruction algorithm, we reconstruct the track of a~primary particle -- either an~electron or a~positron. Then, using this information, we determine the energy of the particle (Section~\ref{sec:energy}).
	
	The~\textbf{\acf{RASD}} uses the standard \ac{TPC} approach. With parallel fields, the drift inside a~uniform electric field remains undistorted (as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:drift}). Therefore, we only need to reconstruct the $z$\nobreakdash-coordinate from the drift time using the known drift velocity. We also assume that the readout coordinates ($x'$,~$y'$,~$t$) are known exactly, neglecting the pads and time binning.
	
	Reconstruction using an~\textbf{Ionization Electron Map} (from now on referred to as \emph{the map}) uses a~simulation of the drift of secondary (ionization) electrons within the detector volume. This simulation can then be used to interpolate the initial position of the secondary electrons. In the first iteration of this method the readout is assumed to be continuous.
	
	We present two algorithms using the map for reconstruction. The~first one uses a~gradient descent algorithm along with trilinear interpolation (see Section~\ref{sec:trilin}) of the map. The~second method uses interpolation on the irregular inverse grid with a~polynomial.
	
	The~\textbf{Discrete Reconstruction} uses the map; instead of reconstructing the exact position of each electron, we reconstruct the center of each hit pad together with the time corresponding to the midpoint of the time bin. The~electron count in each \ac{TPC}~bin (consisting of the pad and the time bin) serves as an~idealized collected charge, which is then used as a~weight in the energy reconstruction fit.
	
	\section{Reconstruction Assuming Steady Drift}
	\label{sec:trackfirst}
		As the first step, we tried to reconstruct a~simulated electron track with a~special set of initial parameters, described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:microfirst}. The~starting point is given by the origin of our coordinate system and its initial direction is given by the positive $x$\nobreakdash-axis. This means the magnetic field of our detector is perpendicular to the momentum of the particle at all times, and we can reduce the problem to two-dimensional space.
		
		For the reconstruction, we decided to use the common method used in a~standard \ac{TPC}\red{~(similar to?, cite some source(s)!)}. We call this method \textit{\acf{RASD}}. This will allow us to explore the significance of the atypical behavior in our \ac{OFTPC}. Additionally, we assume the readout is continuous to further simplify the problem. In this approximation, we reconstruct the initial position of each ionization electron.
		
		The~reconstruction is then defined by the following relations between the coordinates of the detector space and the readout space (see Section~\ref{sec:coor}):
			\begin{align}
				x &= x',\\
				y &= y',\\
				z &= 8\;\text{cm} - d_r = 8\;\text{cm} - v_d t,
			\end{align}
		where $d_r$ is the distance to the readout, and $v_d$ is the drift velocity of electrons in the given gas mixture. At a~phenomenological level, this velocity can be considered as a~function of the electric field~$\bm{E}$ and the magnetic field~$\bm{B}$ as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:drift}.\red{~The~\garfieldpp toolkit uses this fact to accelerate their drift simulation with non-microscopic approaches (could mention in the simulation chapter).} Since we assume a~uniform electric field in the detector and in this~approximation we want to neglect the effect of our unusual magnetic field, we consider the drift velocity constant. We can estimate the drift velocity by fitting the dependence $d_r(t)$ of ionization electrons from a~simulated track with a linear function:
			\begin{equation}
				d_r(t) = v_d t + d_0.
			\end{equation}
		The fit was applied on two tracks with different gas composition, the result is in \cref{fig:zt}.\red{~Compare with real drift velocities -- a good indication of the tilt of drift lines.} The obtained parameters are then used for the reconstruction shown in \cref{fig:rasd_xz}. From the residuals shown in \cref{fig:rasd_res}, we can see that this reconstruction algorithm leads to significant deviations from the simulated track (up to 1.1~cm for 90:10, and up to 0.3~cm for 70:30 Ar:CO$_2$), especially in the faster gas mixture 90:10 (as expected -- for a~higher mean time between collisions in Equation~\ref{eq:drift}, the effect of the magnetic field is bigger). These deviations are mainly caused by the shift in the $x$\nobreakdash-coordinate due to the tilt of the drift lines in magnetic field. In order to account for this, we need to develop a~better algorithm.\red{~There is also a~small irregularity in the $z$\nobreakdash-coordinate but it is comparable with the diffusion. We can/will also later show that this has a significant effect on the reconstructed energy.}

	\section{Ionization Electron Map}
	\label{sec:map}
		Inside an~\ac{OFTPC}\orange{~($\exists$ more than one, also considering it a~general concept rather than the specific OFTPC used at this experiment)}, the drift of the ionization electrons is significantly affected by its magnetic field as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:drift}, see also \cref{fig:microfirst}. We need to take this into account for accurate reconstruction\red{~(should be easy to run the reconstruction without the map and show how much it improves the results)}. In the first approximation, we assume a~continuous readout (i.e., we neglect the anode segmentation into pads). We can then reconstruct the original position of each ionization electron using its readout coordinates. For this purpose, we use the ionization electron map.
		
		The~ionization electron map represents a~mapping from the detector space to the readout space (see Section~\ref{sec:coor}). It tells us what readout coordinates $(x',y',t)$ we can expect on average for an~ionization electron created at the detector coordinates $(x,y,z)$. More precisely, it is a~mapping to the distributions on the readout space; we can simplify this as only the means $\overline{\mathcal{M}}$ and the covariance matrices $\mathcal{M}_\mathbf{\Sigma}$, assuming Gaussian distribution\footnote{The applicability of Gaussian distribution was tested on simulated points of the map using the Mardia's test.}:
			\begin{alignat}{3}
				\overline{\mathcal{M}}&\colon \mathcal{D} \longrightarrow \mathcal{R}, &&(x,y,z) \longmapsto \mathbf{\overline{X}}^T\equiv(\bar{x}',\bar{y}',\bar{t}),\\
				\mathcal{M}_\mathbf{\Sigma}&\colon \mathcal{D} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3\times3}, &&(x,y,z) \longmapsto \mathbf{\Sigma}^{\phantom{T}} \equiv \scalebox{0.9}{$\begin{pmatrix}
					\sigma_{x'}^2 & \operatorname{cov}(x',y') & \operatorname{cov}(x',t) \\
					\operatorname{cov}(y',x') & \sigma_{y'}^2 & \operatorname{cov}(y',t) \\
					\operatorname{cov}(t,x') & \operatorname{cov}(t,y') & \sigma_{t}^2
				\end{pmatrix}$},\\
				\mathcal{M}&\colon \mathcal{D} \longrightarrow D(\mathcal{R}),\ &&(x,y,z) \longmapsto N(\mathbf{X}) \equiv \frac{\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{\overline{X}})^T\mathbf{\Sigma}(\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{\overline{X}}))}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^3 |\mathbf{\Sigma}|}}.
			\end{alignat}
		To get an~approximation of this mapping, we simulate the drift of ionization electrons generated on a~regular Cartesian grid $\mathbb{G}\subset\mathcal{D}$ with spacing~$l$ inside the volume of our \ac{OFTPC}\footnote{The~detector walls are not considered and we simulate the drift even outside of the \ac{OFTPC} which allows us to interpolate even close to the walls} (see the visualization in \cref{fig:map_3d}). In \cref{fig:maplines}, you can see an example of drift lines from a~test of the simulation. After testing runs, two map simulations were made with different gas composition, their parameters are shown in Table~\ref{tab:map}.

		In order to get accurate results, we use the microscopic simulation of these electrons described in Section~\ref{sec:microsim}\red{~(Monte Carlo from \textit{AvalancheMC} was also considered but it doesn't (didn't? CERES used it from MAGBOLTZ???) include magnetic field, we can probably improve this anyway using the fast track simulation with map proposed in the future section)}. It is also useful to simulate multiple~($N$) electrons originating from the same position so that we can account for the random fluctuations due to collisions. Using the readout coordinates of the electrons, we then estimate the means and the covariance matrix:
			\begin{equation}
				\label{eq:cov}
				\mathbf{\overline{X}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{X}_i,\qquad \mathbf{\Sigma} = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\mathbf{X}_i-\mathbf{\overline{X}})(\mathbf{X}_i-\mathbf{\overline{X}})^T,
			\end{equation}
		where $\mathbf{X}_i$ represents the readout coordinates $(x'_i, y'_i, t_i)^T$ of the $i$\nobreakdash-th electron. The matrix (resp. its submatrix) can then be used to plot error ellipsoid (resp. ellipse). The axes correspond to the eigenvectors, errors along these axes for a~given confidence level~$p$ can be computed using the chi\nobreakdash-squared distribution
			\begin{equation}
				\label{eq:sigma}
				\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i \chi^2_k(p)},
			\end{equation}
		where $\lambda_i$ is the corresponding eigenvalue and $k$~is the number of degrees of freedom.
		
		As shown in \cref{fig:map_zt,fig:map_xt}, the drift times in the map are no longer proportional to the $z$\nobreakdash-coordinate due to the varying Lorentz angles in the inhomogeneous magnetic field (see Equation~\ref{eq:lorentz}). As expected, the effect is considerably larger in gases with higher drift velocities. Similarly, the drift distortion (i.e., its deviation from the vertical lines) is huge for the "faster" gas, but still significant for the "slower" one, as demonstrated in \cref{fig:map_yx_all,fig:map_bot,fig:map_xz}.

		When evaluating the map inside the grid, we use trilinear interpolation (see Section~\ref{sec:trilin}). From now on, we will use the same symbol $\mathcal{M}$ for this interpolated simulation.
		
		Finally, we need to invert the map to get the original detector coordinates $(x,y,z)$ from the given readout coordinates $(x',y',t)$. In our case, it is reasonable to assume that the mapping $\overline{\mathcal{M}}$\red{~(we lose the information about the distribution (a~wild idea how to recover this is in the Future section but it will only make sense if the GEM is already accounted for and is very preliminary as there are many factors to consider))} is one-to-one (as seen in the simulations). We implemented two methods for this purpose: the gradient descent search (Section~\ref{sec:grad}) and interpolation on the inverse grid (Section~\ref{sec:interpol}).
		
		\subsection{Map Simulation}
			Simulation of the map is a~computationally heavy task. For this reason, we use the MetaCentrum grid~\cite{metacentrum} to parallelize needed calculations. At first, this was done by evenly distributing the simulated electrons across the individual jobs in a~simulation with only one electron per vertex in the regular grid~$\mathbb{G}$ with a~spacing of one centimeter. Later, a~more efficient approach was implemented, accounting for the varying lengths of the drift of individual electrons. If we index the vertices of~$\mathbb{G}$ in the order of increasing coordinates $y,x,z$\red{~(picture will make things clearer)}, we can express the number~$n_l$ of full XY~layers (i.e., electrons with the same $z$~coordinate, the mapping of one such layer is shown in \cref{fig:map_xyt}) with index less than or equal to $i$
				\begin{equation}
					n_l(i) = \left\lfloor\frac{i}{n_{xy}}\right\rfloor,
				\end{equation}
			where $n_{xy}$ is the number of electrons in each XY~layer calculated simply by counting the electrons that satisfy boundary conditions for $x$~and~$y$.\red{~These conditions should be mentioned above; sector condition + maximal $x$ value.} The~number of electrons remaining in the top layer is then
				\begin{equation}
					n_r(i) = i\!\!\!\!\mod n_{xy}.
				\end{equation}
			Finally, we can calculate the sum of the drift gaps of electrons up to index~$i$
				\begin{equation}
					d_\text{sum} = (z_\text{max}-z_\text{min})n_{xy}n_l-\frac{n_l(n_l-1)}{2}n_{xy}l+n_r(z_\text{max}-z_\text{min}-n_l l).
				\end{equation}
			We then use a~binary search algorithm to find the maximum index $i$ such that the value of this sum is less than the fraction $\frac{\text{job id}}{\text{max job id}}$ of the total sum. This way we obtain the minimal and the maximal index of electrons simulated in the given job.
			
			\red{The~obtained map is then stored in a~custom class template \textit{Field}, could expand on that. Maybe earlier, since the same template is used for the magnetic field.}

		\subsection{Gradient Descent Algorithm}
		\label{sec:grad}			
			The~first implemented method of reconstruction uses a~gradient descent algorithm to calculate an~inversion of the map $\overline{\mathcal{M}}$ in a~given point. Gradient descent is an~iterative minimization algorithm for multivariate functions. Let $R\in\mathcal{R}$ be a~point in the readout space; we want to find a~point $D = (x,y,z) \in\mathcal{D}$ in the detector space such that 
				\begin{equation}
					\overline{\mathcal{M}}(D) = R = (x'_R,y'_R,t_R).
				\end{equation}
			We define a~function~$f_R$ in the readout space as a~distance in this space:
				\begin{equation}
					f_R(x',y',t) = \sqrt{(x'-x'_R)^2+(y'-y'_R)^2+v_d^2(t-t_R)^2},
				\end{equation}
			where $v_d$ is an~approximation of the drift velocity in the \ac{TPC}, obtained from the reconstruction in Section~\ref{sec:trackfirst}\red{~(there will be an image with the linear fit here)}. We make an~initial guess\red{~(actually in the original code we just take $z=0$)}:
				\begin{equation}
					D_0 = (x'_R,y'_R,v_dt).
				\end{equation}
			Assuming we have the $n$-th estimate $D_n$, we calculate the $i$-th component of the gradient of $f_R\circ\overline{\mathcal{M}}$ numerically using central differences:\orange{~(signs look correct)}
				\begin{equation}
					\left[\nabla(f_R\circ\overline{\mathcal{M}})\right]^i(D_n) \approx \frac{f_R(\overline{\mathcal{M}}(D_n+s\cdot e^i))-f_R(\overline{\mathcal{M}}(D_n-s\cdot e^i))}{2s},
				\end{equation}
			where $e^i\in\mathcal{D}$ is the $i$-th coordinate vector and $s$ is the step size. The~step size should be sufficiently small; initially, we set it as a~fraction $s = \frac{l}{10}$ of the map's grid spacing $l$. During the minimization, we check that $f_R(\overline{\mathcal{M}}(D_n))<10s$ at all times and decrease the step if needed. The~next iteration can be calculated as follows:
				\begin{equation}
					D_{n+1} = D_n - \gamma \nabla(f_R\circ\overline{\mathcal{M}})(D_n),
				\end{equation}
			where $\gamma\in\mathbb{R}^+$ is the damping coefficient. It should be set to a~small enough value to ensure convergence, but large enough for sufficient converging speed. In order to avoid oscillation around the minimum, we also check that the size of the damped gradient does not exceed (or get too close to) the current value of the non-negative function:
				\begin{equation}
					10 \norm{\gamma \nabla(f_R\circ\overline{\mathcal{M}})(D_n)} < f_R(D_n),
				\end{equation}
			and lower $\gamma$ otherwise. The~minimization stops either when the error $f_R(\overline{\mathcal{M}}(D_n))$ drops below a~specified value or when the number of iterations exceeds a~certain limit (in this case, a~message is printed into the console).
			
			The parameters of this method can be further optimized (e.g., a~better choice of $\gamma$ and~$s$, analytical computation of the gradient\footnote{The gradient can be computed analytically when using the trilinear interpolation, see \cref{eq:trilinpoly}.}); instead, we later decided to use the interpolation on the inverse grid described in the next section.
			
			\red{Typical evolution of $D_n$ during search? Not sure if this has to be cited.}
		
		\subsection{Interpolation on the Inverse Grid}
		\label{sec:interpol}			
			The~best current algorithm uses the interpolation on the inverse grid. Rather than inverting the trilinearly interpolated map using a~numerical minimization method as in the previous section, we take advantage of the fact that the map $\overline{\mathcal{M}}$ is one-to-one\orange{~(isomorphism is supposed to preserve structure, not sure how to interpret that here, }\red{not the best description, we already (kind of) assume it is a~bijection by saying we will invert it)}. Since we have simulated values of this map on a~regular grid in the detector space $\mathcal{D}$, we also know the inverse map $\overline{\mathcal{M}}^{-1}$ on the irregular inverse grid in the readout space $\mathcal{R}$. To get an~approximation of the inverse map in the entire readout space, we can use interpolation\orange{~(general concept, the specific choice is described below)}.
			
			Since the inverse grid is irregular, trilinear interpolation cannot be applied. Given that the simulated map is dense enough to provide a~good approximation considering the size of our pads, we can adopt a~similar approach.\footnote{A more complicated and computationally heavy alternative would be natural neighbor interpolation or Kriging.} As shown in Equation~\ref{eq:trilinpoly} in Section~\ref{sec:trilin}, trilinear interpolation\orange{~(shouldn't need an article when talking about a~general concept)} can be expressed as a~polynomial:
				\begin{equation}
					\widehat{f}(x,y,z) = axyz + bxy + cxz + dyz + ex + fy + gz + h,
				\end{equation}
			where $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h$ are coefficients uniquely determined by the values of the function at the vertices of the interpolation cell\orange{~(can be calculated in the way shown in the mentioned equation, not sure what more to add)}. We can generalize this for a~function defined on an~irregular grid. Given the function values at any eight points, we can write a~system of eight linear equations
				\begin{equation}
					\begin{pmatrix}
						x_1 y_1 z_1 & x_1 y_1 & x_1 z_1 & y_1 z_1 & x_1 & y_1 & z_1 & 1\\
						\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
						x_8 y_8 z_8 & x_8 y_8 & x_8 z_8 & y_8 z_8 & x_8 & y_8 & z_8 & 1
					\end{pmatrix}
					\begin{pmatrix}
						a\\
						\vdots\\
						h
					\end{pmatrix}
					=
					\begin{pmatrix}
						f(x_1,y_1,z_1)\\
						\vdots\\
						f(x_8,y_8,z_8)
					\end{pmatrix},
				\end{equation}
			which has a~unique solution for the coefficients for most values of $(x_n, y_n, z_n)$ and $f(x_n,y_n,z_n)$, where $n\in\{1,\ldots,8\}$.
			
			This approach introduces a~small complication: finding the correct pseudocell (i.e., the image of eight vertices forming a~cubic cell in the regular grid) in the inverse grid. The~eight irregularly spaced vertices of this pseudocell do not define a~unique volume, so there are multiple possible ways to partition $\mathcal{R}$ into pseudocells, with no obvious choice among them. This problem could be solved by determining the exact volume boundary using the gradient descent search described above. However, since the difference between the interpolation polynomials is small near the boundary of the pseudocell, we choose one of them arbitrarily.
			
			In the code, the map is stored in an array, and its individual points can be accessed using three indexes corresponding to the $x$, $y$, and~$z$ coordinates. Points outside of the area of the simulation are initialized with zeros. The search for the pseudocell finds the indices corresponding to the eight vertices. It starts by performing a~binary search along the $x$\nobreakdash-coordinate (comparing the $x'$\nobreakdash-coordinate of the map vertices with that of the point, whose preimage we want to find) with indices corresponding to~$y$ and~$z$ fixed to half of their maximal value. After that, we fix the $x$ and $z$ indices and perform a binary search along~$y$ (making sure to exclude the zeros from initialization outside the simulation range beforehand), and finally, we fix the $x$ and $y$ indices and perform a search along~$z$ (inverted, since higher~$z$ corresponds to lower~$t$). This procedure is then repeated until the pseudocell "contains" the preimage of the given point (meaning that for all readout coordinates $x'$, $y'$, $t$, there is a~vertex of the pseudocell with a~higher and a~vertex with a~lower value of that coordinate).\red{~Or until 3 iterations are exceeded, then we print an error message. We also attempt to fix the error by choosing a neighboring cell.}
			
			This approach should generally be faster than the gradient descent method, since we do not need to iterate. Currently, we are calculating the coefficients of the interpolation polynomial during the reconstruction of every point. If further optimization is needed in the future, we can precalculate them for the whole map.
			
		\section{Reconstruction testing}
			The continuous reconstruction using the map was tested on microscopic tracks with parameters described in \cref{sec:microfirst}. The difference between the reconstructed positions obtained using the two map inversion algorithms was found to be smaller than the uncertainty from diffusion by several orders of magnitude. In its unoptimized state, the gradient descent search was significantly slower (at least ten times) than the interpolation on the inverse grid.
			
			An example of reconstruction of tracks in 90:10 and 70:30 Ar:CO$_2$ gas mixture is shown in \cref{fig:reco_map}. We can clearly see that the results have improved compare to the \acf{RASD} (shown in \cref{fig:rasd_xz}). A~comparison of the residuals of reconstructed positions (i.e., their distances to the real starting positions) is shown in \cref{fig:rasd_map}. The histograms of residuals, as well as residuals of individual coordinates, are shown in \cref{fig:9010_map_res,fig:7030_map_res}. The bin width for the histograms was chosen using the Scott's rule\footnote{The optimal bin width for normally distributed data of size~$N$ with sample standard deviation $\hat{\sigma}$ is $\hat{\sigma}\sqrt[3]{\frac{24\sqrt{\pi}}{N}}$~\cite{scott}.}. As expected, the mean values of the coordinate residuals is zero. The only exception is the $z$\nobreakdash-coordinate in the 70:30 Ar:CO$_2$ track, where the mean is \qty{-0.064}{\cm} (further than one standard deviation \qty{0.051}{\cm} from zero). This is caused by the non-zero initial energy of the ionization electrons (neglected in the other track) which is unaccounted for in the map simulation. Since the primary electron bends towards negative~$z$, the ionization electrons are more likely to be released in this direction (and also bend in the magnetic field towards this direction).

	\section{Discrete Reconstruction}
		\red{Reconstruction with pads and time bins. Maybe testing different pads.}
		
		\red{It is also possible to make this a~subsection of the map, making the previous subsections parts of a~new subsection 'Map Inversion'.}
		
		In order to get a~more realistic representation of a~track measured in the \ac{OFTPC}, we need to take the discretization of the position and time data into account. The~readout of the \ac{OFTPC} will consist of 128~pads, their layout is shown in \cref{fig:padlayout}. Time is read out in discrete bins of size $t_\text{bin} = \qty{100}{\ns}$.
		
		As the first approximation, we can neglect the multiplication in the triple\nobreakdash-\ac{GEM} and assume an~ideal charge readout. The~time measurement starts at the beginning of the electron/positron simulation\orange{~(depending on the specific simulation it can correspond to the production in the target or when entering the OFTPC, here the specific time doesn't matter too much since the primary particle travels basically at light speed (30~ps/cm) which is circa immediate given the time binning)}.\red{~Randomize this time a bit and see what it does to the reconstruction ($\rightarrow$ Future?).} The~readout coordinates ${(x',y',t)\in\mathcal{R}}$ of each ionization electron can be mapped to the pad coordinates~$(n_\text{pad},n_t) \in \mathcal{P}$:
			\begin{gather}
				n_\text{pad} = n\colon (x',y') \in \left[x_{1,n}-\frac{g}{2},x_{2,n}+\frac{g}{2}\right)\times\left[y_{1,n}-\frac{g}{2},y_{2,n}+\frac{g}{2}\right),\\
				n_t = \left\lceil \frac{t}{t_\text{bin}}\right\rceil,
			\end{gather}
		where $x,y_{1,n}$ and $x,y_{2,n}$ are the opposing pad corner coordinates, and $g$ is the gap between the pads (described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:coor}). This way, the closest pad is assigned to each readout position within the \ac{OFTPC} volume\footnote{Some positions near the wall are not handled and some pads extend beyond the \ac{OFTPC} volume.\red{~This is where an~electric field simulation would come in handy.}}.\red{~Makes sense since the pads attract the electrons, the inhomogeneity of electric field is neglected.} The number of electrons collected by each pad (i.e., collected charge) in each time bin is then counted and serves as a~weight for the energy reconstruction. The~reconstructed track consists of points for each $(n,n_t)\in\mathcal{P}$, we get these by reconstructing the position of a~hypothetical electron with the readout coordinates of the pad/time bin center:\footnote{Mapping the center of the pad (along with the midpoint of the time bin) isn't necessarily the best approach since it might not correspond to the average parameters of an~electron with these readout parameters.}
			\begin{equation}
				\mathcal{D} \ni (x,y,z) = \overline{\mathcal{M}}\left(x_{c,n},y_{c,n},\left(n_t-\frac{1}{2}\right)t_\text{bin}\right).
			\end{equation}
