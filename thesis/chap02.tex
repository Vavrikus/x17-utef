\chapter{Track Simulation}
	In order to develop and test the~reconstruction algorithm, electron and positron tracks are simulated inside the~first sector $\mathcal{D}_1$ of our detector (see Section~\ref{sec:coor}) with different initial parameters. Two approaches are currently used to simulate tracks, each of them for different purpose.
	
	The~\textbf{Microscopic Simulation} uses the~\garfieldpp toolkit~\cite{Garfield++}. Within this toolkit, the~\ac{HEED} program~\cite{HEED} is used to simulate the~primary particle and the~class \textit{AvalancheMicroscopic} to simulate the~drift of secondary electrons created by ionization in the~gas. This is the~most precise and time-consuming simulation used; our current goal is to be able to successfully reconstruct its results and determine our best-case energy resolution.
	
	The~\textbf{Runge-Kutta Simulation} uses the~4th order Runge-Kutta numerical integration (\textcolor{red}{add citation for Runge-Kutta}) to simulate the~trajectory of the~primary particle in the~electromagnetic field inside the~detector. It is relatively fast since it does not simulate the~secondary particles. It is used as part of our reconstruction algorithm and for testing some parts of the~reconstruction.
	
	All of these simulations require the~knowledge of the~electromagnetic field inside the~detector. A~uniform electric field of 400~V$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$ is assumed. The~magnetic field was simulated in Maxwell (see Section~\ref{sec:mag}). \textcolor{red}{add citation}

	\section{Microscopic Simulation}
	\label{sec:microsim}
		The~microscopic simulation, the~most detailed simulation used in this work, is performed using the~Garfield++ toolkit~\cite{Garfield++}.
		
		The~electron transport properties are simulated using the~program Magboltz~(\textcolor{red}{Add citation.}). Two different gas mixtures were used: 90\%~Ar~+~10\%~CO$_2$ and 70\%~Ar~+~30\%~CO$_2$. The~second mixture will be used in our detector. The~temperature is set to 20~$^\circ$C, the~pressure is atmospheric.
		
		The~primary track is simulated using the~program~\ac{HEED}~\cite{HEED}, which is an implementation of the~photo-absorption ionization model. This program provides the~parameters of ionizing collisions. \ac{HEED} can also be used to simulate the~transport of delta electrons; we do not account for these in the~current simulation but plan to include them in the~future. The~photons created in the~atomic relaxation cascade (\textcolor{red}{fluorescence reabsorption, ?}) are also not simulated.
		
		Finally, we use the~microscopic tracking provided by the~class \textit{AvalancheMicroscopic} to simulate the~drift of the~ionization electrons. Each electron is followed from collision to collision using the~equation of motion and the~collision rates calculated by Magboltz.
		
		\textcolor{red}{First simulated track in the~$z$ direction should be described in detail here (own subsection?). Figures.}
		
		\textcolor{red}{Add more detailed and better description of HEED, and microscopic tracking (each their own subsection?). Could also mention Monte Carlo (requires gas file generation - Magboltz) and Runge-Kutta simulation implemented in Garfield, why we don't use them (another subsection? rename the~section to \garfieldpp simulation and mention all relevant parts?).}
