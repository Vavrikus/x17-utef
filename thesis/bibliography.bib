Most impressively, advances in accelerator design over the last three decades have led to an increase in beam energies of nearly three orders of magnitude, and the advent of colliding‐beam machines has brought a comparable increase to the center‐of‐mass energy available. The diversity of useful beam species has now grown to include essentially all known particles with lifetimes greater than 10−11 seconds.},

	abstract = {A computer modeling of ionization is necessary for the simulation of gaseous detectors of fast charged particles. The interactions of the incident particle with matter are well described by the photoabsorption ionization (PAI) model, which is based on the relation between the energy deposited by the fast charged particle in a medium and the photoabsorption cross-section of this medium. Some modification of the PAI model energy-transfer cross-section allows to distinguish the interactions with different atomic shells and to determine the energy of the primary photoelectrons and possible atomic relaxation cascades. Further simulation of paths and absorption of secondary particles results in a realistic reproduction of the space distributions and amount of initial ionization.}

	ABSTRACT = {Recently, when examining the differential internal pair creation coefficients of 8Be, 4He and 12C nuclei, we observed peak-like anomalies in the angular correlation of the e+e− pairs. This was interpreted as the creation and immediate decay of an intermediate bosonic particle with a mass of mXc2≈ 17 MeV, receiving the name X17 in subsequent publications. In this paper, our latest results obtained for the X17 particle are presented by investigating the e+e− pair correlations in the decay of the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) of 8Be. Our results initiated a significant number of new experiments all over the world to detect the X17 particle and determine its properties. In this paper, we will also conduct a mini-review of the experiments whose results are already published, as well as the ones closest to being published.},

It is the main device for pattern recognition, tracking, and identification of charged particles in the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC. The TPC is cylindrical in shape with a volume close to 90m3 and is operated in a 0.5T solenoidal magnetic field parallel to its axis. In this paper we describe in detail the design considerations for this detector for operation in the extreme multiplicity environment of central Pb–Pb collisions at LHC energy. The implementation of the resulting requirements into hardware (field cage, read-out chambers, electronics), infrastructure (gas and cooling system, laser-calibration system), and software led to many technical innovations which are described along with a presentation of all the major components of the detector, as currently realized. We also report on the performance achieved after completion of the first round of stand-alone calibration runs and demonstrate results close to those specified in the TPC Technical Design Report.}

	abstract = {A large Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is the main device for tracking and particle identification in the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In the upcoming Run 3, the LHC will deliver lead beams colliding at an interaction rate of up to 50kHz. In order to read out all minimum bias events in Pb–Pb collisions, the TPC was upgraded with an amplification stage based on Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) and new front-end electronics. With the new amplification stage, a trigger-less operation of the TPC becomes possible, resulting in a continuous readout without dead time. The exchange of the readout chambers and front-end electronics took place in a dedicated clean room in 2019/20. The upgraded TPC was then moved back to its designated position at the interaction point 2 of the LHC and an extensive commissioning programme was carried out. It includes, inter alia, noise studies, measurements of laser tracks, irradiation of the TPC with an intense X-ray source, the flushing of radioactive 83mKr into the active volume and the operation during the first proton–proton collisions provided by the LHC. During these measurements, the TPC operated at nominal conditions and the continuous readout capability was tested successfully.}

The momentum interval covered corresponds to $0.01 < z < 0.90$, where $z = p/p_{\text{beam}}$. The analysis is based on approximately 70 pb$^{-1}$ of data collected between 1984 and 1986 with the TPC2$\gamma$ detector at PEP. Charged particles are identified by a simultaneous measurement of momentum and ionization energy loss ($dE/dx$). The upgraded detector's momentum resolution of $(\Delta p/p)^2 = (1.5\%)^2 + (0.65\% \cdot p~[\text{GeV}/c])^2$ and a $dE/dx$ resolution of typically 3.5\% allow the measurements to be extended to higher $z$ than previously reported. 70 refs., 59 figs., 7 tabs.}

	abstract = { The gravitational interaction of antimatter and matter has never been directly probed. ALPHA-g is a novel experiment that aims to perform the first measurement of the antihydrogen gravitational mass. A fundamental requirement for this new apparatus is a position sensitive particle detector around the antihydrogen trap which provides information about antihydrogen annihilation location. The proposed detector is a radial Time Projection Chamber, or rTPC, whose concept is being developed at TRIUMF. A simulation of the detector and the development of the reconstruction software, used to determine the antihydrogen annihilation point, is presented alongside with the expected performance of the rTPC. }

	abstract = {In this paper the formula for the optimal histogram bin width is derived which asymptotically minimizes the integrated mean squared error. Monte Carlo methods are used to verify the usefulness of this formula for small samples. A data-based procedure for choosing the bin width parameter is proposed, which assumes a Gaussian reference standard and requires only the sample size and an estimate of the standard deviation. The sensitivity of the procedure is investigated using several probability models which violate the Gaussian assumption.},
