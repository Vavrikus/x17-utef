	\subsection{Coordinate Systems}
	\label{sec:coor}
		In order to describe events in our detector, we use three distinct spaces: the~detector space $\mathcal{D}$, the~readout space $\mathcal{R}$ and the~pad space $\mathcal{P}$. Each space is later used to represent ionization electrons at different stages of the~detection process: their creation in the gas, their final position when hitting the readout plane, and finally their representation in the discrete pad space.
	
	\subsubsection{Detector Space}
		The~detector space $\mathcal{D}$ represents the~physical space of our detector. We describe it using Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. The~$z$-axis is the~detector's axis of symmetry, with its negative direction aligned with the~proton beam. The~origin $(0,0,0)$ is located at the~center of the~irradiated target. The~positive $x$\nobreakdash-axis passes through the~center of one the~\ac{OFTPC}s along the~intersection of its two planes of symmetry. The~$y$\nobreakdash-axis is then chosen to maintain a~right-handed coordinate system.
		
		Since the~detector has a~hexagonal symmetry, we use only one of its sectors in this work -- the~first sector $\mathcal{D}_1 \subset \mathcal{D}$ which is defined by the~condition:
			\begin{equation}
				(x,y,z) \in \mathcal{D}_1 \Leftrightarrow |y| \leq x\tan \frac{\pi}{6}.
			\end{equation}
		Simulations in this sector can be applied to all sectors by rotating the coordinates accordingly. The~volume of the~\ac{OFTPC} in this sector, which has the~shape of a~trapezoidal prism, has these boundaries:
			\begin{linenomath}
				\begin{align}
					x \in [x_\text{min},x_\text{max}] &= [6.51, 14.61] \;\text{cm},\\
					z \in [z_\text{min},z_\text{max}] &= [-8,8] \;\text{cm},\\
					y_\text{max}(x_\text{min}) = -y_\text{min}(x_\text{min}) &=  2.75\;\text{cm},\\
					y_\text{max}(x_\text{max}) = -y_\text{min}(x_\text{max}) &=  7.45\;\text{cm},
				\end{align}
			\end{linenomath}
		where $y_\text{max}(x)$ is the~maximal value of the~$y$-coordinate for a~given $x$. The~readout is located at $z = 8$~cm; for some purposes, we also define the distance to the~readout $d_r = 8\;\text{cm}-z$ as an~alternative to the~$z$-coordinate. \textcolor{red}{Keeping this paragraph as it is because the~\ac{OFTPC} volume is distinct from the~first sector and some parts of this thesis use the~space beyond this volume.}
		
		\subsubsection{Readout Space}
			The~readout space $\mathcal{R}$ represents the~drift time and final positions of ionization electrons as measured by an~ideal continuous readout. We describe it using coordinates $(x',y',t)$, where $x'$ and $y'$ correspond to the~detector coordinates at the readout plane ($z = 8$~cm). \textcolor{red}{Currently not entirely sure how to put this into a~figure since only $x'$ and $y'$ correspond to the~detector coordinates. The drift time~$t$ is approximately proportional to~$d_r$.}
		
		\subsubsection{Pad Space}
			The~pad space $\mathcal{P}$ represents the~time bin and pad number of ionization electrons as measured by an~ideal discrete readout. \textcolor{red}{It is not really a~subspace of $\mathcal{R}$ but there is a mapping from $\mathcal{R}$ to $\mathcal{P}$. It is a discretization of a~part of $\mathcal{R}$, the mapping can be adjusted depending on the~simulation. If we assume uniform electric field there will be gaps, we don't use gaps in the reconstruction since the~electrons should be pulled towards the~pads.}
			
			The~readout of the~\ac{OFTPC} will consist (\textcolor{red}{is the design final?}) of 128~rectangular pads arranged in a~staggered pattern (\textcolor{red}{add image where all the parameters are marked}). Most of the~pads are $0.6 \times 0.9$~cm, only pads 102 and 124 are $0.6 \times 0.6$~cm, pad 127 is $0.6 \times 0.509$~cm. The~distance of neighboring pads is 0.08~cm, staggering offset is 0.3946~cm.

	\subsection{Magnetic Field Simulation}
	\label{sec:mag}
		\textcolor{red}{Magnetic field simulations in Maxwell (citation). Some figures. When working with the~magnetic field outside the~regular grid, we use trilinear interpolation.}
	
		\subsubsection{Trilinear Interpolation}
		\label{sec:trilin}
			Trilinear interpolation is a~3D generalization of linear interpolation. It can be used to interpolate a~function whose values are known on a~regular grid with rectangular prism cells. We use this simple method for interpolating the~magnetic field, and it is later used in Section~\ref{sec:grad} to interpolate the~Ionization Electron Map, a~key component of our track reconstruction algorithm. In both cases, we use a~regular cubic grid (\textcolor{red}{apparently it is also called a~Cartesian grid}).
			
			\textcolor{red}{Could put a~paragraph about linear interpolation here if it is not clear from the~equations below.}
			
			Let us consider a~cell of our regular grid (a~cube) with an~edge of length~$a$ containing the~point $\mathbf{C} = (x,y,z)$ where we want to interpolate a~function $f\!\!:~\!\!\mathbb{R}^3\,\to\,\mathbb{R}$. We know the~values of this function at the~vertices of the~cell $\mathbf{C}_{ijk} = (x_0+ia,y_0+ja,z_0+ka)$, where $i,j,k \in \{0,1\}$ are indices. We also define the~points $\mathbf{C}_{ij} = (x,y_0+ia,z_0+ja)$ and $\mathbf{C}_i=(x,y,z_0+ia)$. Then the~interpolated value $\widehat{f}(\mathbf{C})$ can be calculated as a~composition of three linear interpolations (see Figure~\ref{fig:trilin}):
				\begin{alignat}{3}
					\widehat{f}(\mathbf{C}_{ij}) &= (1-x_d)\,f(\mathbf{C}_{0ij}) \,&+&\,x_d\, f(\mathbf{C}_{1ij}),\\
					\widehat{f}(\mathbf{C}_{i}) &= (1-y_d)\,\widehat{f}(\mathbf{C}_{0i}) &+&\,y_d\, \widehat{f}(\mathbf{C}_{1i}),\\
					\widehat{f}(\mathbf{C}) &= (1-z_d)\,\widehat{f}(\mathbf{C}_0) &+&\,z_d\, \widehat{f}(\mathbf{C}_1),
				\end{alignat}
			where $x_d$, $y_d$, and $z_d$ are given as follows:
				\begin{equation}
					x_d = \frac{x-x_0}{a},~y_d = \frac{y-y_0}{a},~z_d = \frac{z-z_0}{a}.
				\end{equation}
			We can also write
				\begin{eqnarray}
					\widehat{f}(\mathbf{C}) = \sum_{i,j,k \in \{0,1\}} t_x^i t_y^j t_z^k f(\mathbf{C}_{ijk}),\\
					t_\alpha \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \begin{pmatrix}t_\alpha^0\\ t_\alpha^1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1-\alpha_d\\ \alpha_d\end{pmatrix},
				\end{eqnarray}
			where $\alpha \in \{x,y,z\}$ is an index. Furthermore, we can write $\widehat{f}(\mathbf{C})$ as a~polynomial:
				\begin{equation}
					\label{eq:trilinpoly}
					\widehat{f}(\mathbf{C}) = \sum_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma \in \{0,1\}}\sum^{\alpha}_{i=0}\sum^{\beta}_{j=0}\sum^{\gamma}_{k=0} 	(-1)^{(\alpha-i)+(\beta-j)+(\gamma-k)} f(\mathbf{C}_{ijk}) x_d^\alpha y_d^\beta z_d^\gamma.
				\end{equation}
			We take advantage of this form when generalizing trilinear interpolation to irregular grid in section~\ref{sec:interpol}.
				
				%\begin{equation}
				%	\widehat{f}(C) = (1-x_d) (1-y_d) (1-z_d) f(C_{000}) + (1-x_d) (1-y_d) z_d f(C_{001}) + (1-x_d) y_d (1-z_d) f(C_{010}) + (1-x_d) y_d z_d f(C_{011}) + x_d (1-y_d) (1-z_d) f(C_{100}) + x_d (1-y_d) z_d f(C_{101}) + x_d y_d (1-z_d) f(C_{110}) + x_d y_d z_d f(C_{111})
				%\end{equation}
