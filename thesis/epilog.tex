	\section*{Notes}
		\textcolor{red}{General notes about the~thesis:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textcolor{red}{Check that all of the~classes and other code are marked the~same way in the~text. I used italics somewhere, could use different font for this instead.}
			\item \textcolor{red}{Check unbreakable space in front of articles. Remove excessive article usage with proper nouns.}
			\item \textcolor{red}{Only electrons that start and end in the~sector closer than 0.5~cm are used for reconstruction (newest version).}
