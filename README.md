# X17 TPC simulation and reconstruction
C++ code in this project uses ROOT and Garfield++ to simulate and reconstruct electron and positron tracks inside the atypic TPC of the X17 project. The workflow is split between several scripts.

## Installation
The user needs to have ROOT installed (built on 6.26/06), for running simulations Garfield++ has to be installed. Currently used simulation results are provided.
Scripts have to be compiled before running:

```bash
cd /path/to/project/folder
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./script_name
```

All of the binaries will be saved to the newly made build folder. This might lead to errors in the scripts whenever relative paths are used.

### Map simulation
The map of the ionization electron drift can be simulated on MetaCentrum:
1. Files need to be synchronized and compiled (can be achieved by adjusting *sync.sh* and *remote_compile.sh*).
2. Directory *data/ion_map/new_sample* should be cleared so no files get overwritten.
3. Simulation is started by executing *ion_multiple.sh*:

    ```bash
    ./ion_multiple.sh num_of_threads step_size_cm num_of_iterations_per_electron
    ```
    Make sure wall time and memory inside *ion_single.sh* are sufficient.
4. After the job finishes, output files ion(id).root and ion(id).out are sent into the data directory. You can fetch them by adjusting *fetch_data.sh*.
5. Map can be compiled using script *make_map.cpp* (ion.root files have to be in the data directory).

### Microscopic track simulation
Microscopic tracks can be simulated on MetaCentrum:
1. Files need to be synchronized and compiled (can be achieved by adjusting *sync.sh* and *remote_compile.sh*).
2. Directory *data/micro_tracks/new_tracks* should be cleared so no files get overwritten.
3. Simulation is started by executing *track_multi.sh*:

    ```bash
    ./track_multi.sh num_of_threads num_of_iterations_per_track num_of_angle_bins num_of_energy_bins
    ```
    If only *num_of_threads* parameter is provided the track parameters will be random instead of grid-like. Make sure wall time and memory inside *track_single.sh* are sufficient.
4. After the job finishes, output files track_full(id).root, track_small(id).root and tracks(id).out are sent into the data directory. You can fetch them by adjusting *fetch_data.sh*.
5. The tracks can be reconstructed with the reco_track script.
